## üéØ Design Philosophy

This launcher follows the principle of "progressive disclosure" - presenting information and options
when needed without overwhelming the user. It's designed to:

- **Guide newcomers** through the complex setup process
- **Speed up experienced users** with automatic modes
- **Provide flexibility** for customization needs
- **Handle errors gracefully** with recovery options
- **Document everything** for learning and troubleshooting

The goal is to transform a complex multi-script setup into a single, user-friendly experience while
maintaining the modularity and flexibility of the individual components.
